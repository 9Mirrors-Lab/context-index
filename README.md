## ðŸ§© How to Use with GitMCP

You can browse or query these repos using [gitmcp.io](https://gitmcp.io):

1. Instantly create a Remote MCP server for any GitHub repository
2. Simply change the domain from github.com or github.io to gitmcp.io and get instant AI context for any GitHub repository.
3. Select any `know-*` repo from the list
4. View or query its contents using the GitMCP interface
5. To integrate with Claude or Cursor, copy the `mcp.json` URL from the repo

> These repositories are designed for zero-config ingestion by LLM tools that support GitMCP or local MCP engines.
