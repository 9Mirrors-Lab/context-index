Title: Context Index Knowledge Routing for Multi-Domain AI Agents

This repository provides a canonical, machine-readable index of all high-signal, MCP-ready knowledge repositories in the 9Mirrors-Lab organization. It solves the problem of context discovery and routing for AI agents by mapping domain-specific knowledge bases and their MCP endpoints. Ideal for agents and LLM tools needing to ground themselves in the correct context for completions, workflows, or orchestration.

Key Components:
• README.md: Human- and AI-optimized index of all `know-*` and MCP-backed repos – descriptions and direct GitMCP links – use for quick discovery and onboarding.
• Repo Table: Structured mapping of repo name → description → MCP endpoint – enables zero-config context ingestion and routing.
• Auto-update Action: Keeps the index current as new knowledge repos are added – ensures agents always have access to the latest context.

Tips or Insights:
• Architecture Pattern: Centralized index, zero-config routing, and recursive context traversal – enables scalable, multi-domain orchestration.
• Naming Convention: All domain repos use `know-*` or MCP-specific names – instant discoverability and extension.
• Domain Assumptions: All listed repos are high-signal, AI-optimized, and MCP-ready – no noise, no legacy cruft.
• Integration Points: GitMCP, Claude, Cursor, and any LLM tool supporting MCP – use provided links for direct context ingestion.
• Search Patterns: "context-index", "MCP index", "9Mirrors-Lab knowledge", "know-*" – use to find or extend the index.

MCP-Specific Considerations:
• Structured Knowledge: All domain repos are discoverable and linked here for agent traversal.
• Tool Integration: GitMCP links provide instant, zero-config context for any agent or workflow.
• Context Preservation: Each domain repo maintains its own context; this index routes queries accurately and prevents domain mixing.
• Actionable Patterns: Agents can recursively traverse from the index to any domain and ingest the correct context for completions, workflows, or orchestration.

Best used by agents that need to discover, select, and ground themselves in the right knowledge base for any supported topic. Particularly valuable for orchestrating multi-domain workflows, context routing, and zero-hallucination completions.
