Title: Master MCP Index for AI Knowledge Repositories

This repository is the canonical, machine-readable index for all high-signal, MCP-ready knowledge repositories in the 9Mirrors-Lab organization. It enables AI agents, GitMCP, and LLM tools to discover, route, and ground themselves in the correct domain-specific context for any supported topic or workflow.

Key Components:
• README.md: Human- and AI-optimized index of all `know-*` and MCP-backed repos, with descriptions and direct GitMCP links.
• Repo Table: Structured mapping of repo name → description → MCP endpoint for zero-config context ingestion.
• Auto-update Action: (if present) Keeps the index current as new knowledge repos are added.

Tips or Insights:
• Architecture Pattern: Centralized index, zero-config routing, and recursive context traversal—enables scalable, multi-domain orchestration.
• Naming Convention: All domain repos use `know-*` or MCP-specific names for instant discoverability.
• Domain Assumptions: All listed repos are high-signal, AI-optimized, and MCP-ready—no noise, no legacy cruft.
• Integration Points: GitMCP, Claude, Cursor, and any LLM tool supporting MCP—use the provided links for direct context ingestion.
• Search Patterns: "context-index", "MCP index", "9Mirrors-Lab knowledge", "know-*"—use to find or extend the index.

MCP-Specific Considerations:
• Structured Knowledge: All domain repos are discoverable and linked here for agent traversal.
• Tool Integration: GitMCP links provide instant, zero-config context for any agent or workflow.
• Context Preservation: Each domain repo maintains its own context; this index routes queries accurately and prevents domain mixing.
• Actionable Patterns: Agents can recursively traverse from the index to any domain and ingest the correct context for completions, workflows, or orchestration.

Best used by agents and LLM tools that need to discover, select, and ground themselves in the right knowledge base for any supported topic. Particularly valuable for orchestrating multi-domain workflows, context routing, and zero-hallucination completions.
