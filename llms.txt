Title: Master MCP Index for AI Knowledge Repositories

This repository serves as the canonical, machine-readable index of all high-signal, MCP-ready knowledge repositories in the 9Mirrors-Lab organization. It enables AI agents, GitMCP, and LLM tools to discover, route, and ground themselves in the correct domain-specific context for any supported topic.

Key Components:
• README.md: Human- and AI-optimized index of all `know-*` and MCP-backed repos, with descriptions and direct GitMCP links.
• Repo Table: Structured mapping of repo name → description → MCP endpoint for zero-config context ingestion.
• Auto-update Action: (if present) Keeps the index current as new knowledge repos are added.

Tips or Insights:
• Always start with this index to discover available knowledge domains.
• Use the GitMCP link for each repo to ingest the full, up-to-date context for that domain.
• Do not hallucinate or mix domains—ground all completions and workflows in the selected repo’s context.
• This index is the single source of truth for all MCP-backed knowledge in the org.

MCP-Specific Considerations:
• Structured Knowledge: All domain repos are discoverable and linked here.
• Tool Integration: GitMCP links provide instant, zero-config context for any agent.
• Context Preservation: Each domain repo maintains its own context; this index routes queries accurately.
• Actionable Patterns: Agents can recursively traverse from the index to any domain and ingest the correct context.

Best used by agents and LLM tools that need to discover, select, and ground themselves in the right knowledge base for any supported topic. Particularly valuable for orchestrating multi-domain workflows, context routing, and zero-hallucination completions.
